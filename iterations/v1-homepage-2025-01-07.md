# Iteration v1: Homepage - January 7, 2025

## Summary
First working homepage build for Abundant Strategies website.

## Key Decisions Made

### 1. AI Count Accuracy
**Problem:** Original copy claimed "65+ agents" which was inaccurate.
**Decision:** Changed to "Builder" label with description "Production AI systems — from research pipelines to multi-agent teams"
**Rationale:** The point is that she builds, not a specific number. More honest and defensible.

**Changed in:**
- The Proof section: "65+" → "Builder"
- Card 3 ("Leaders Building What's Next"): "65+ custom agents" → "research pipelines, multi-agent teams, custom tools"
- The Difference section: same language
- SEO meta description: "65+ AI systems built" → "Production AI builder"

### 2. Cards Visibility Fix
**Problem:** "Who I Work With" cards were truncated on first load - couldn't see who she works with without scrolling.
**Solution:**
- Tightened hero padding: `py-12/md:py-16/lg:py-20` (was py-24/lg:py-32)
- Moved logo bar into hero section (was in The Proof section)
- Tightened "Who I Work With" section: `py-12/md:py-16` (was py-20)

### 3. Font Setup
**Decision:** Montserrat for headlines (font-display class), Segoe UI for body
**Implementation:** next/font/google with CSS variable `--font-montserrat`
**Fix applied:** Moved font variable to `<html>` element for better CSS inheritance

### 4. Design System Colors
```css
--ink: #333333      /* Primary text */
--stone: #555555    /* Secondary emphasis */
--slate: #666666    /* Body text */
--mist: #767676     /* Section headers */
--fog: #888888      /* Light text */
--cloud: #999999    /* Lightest text */
--background: #fff  /* White background */
--whisper: #fafafa  /* Subtle gray background */
--border: #e0e0e0   /* Border color */
```
